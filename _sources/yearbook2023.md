- [Indent rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow): use colors to visualize indentation levels.
- [Gremlins tracker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nhoizey.gremlins): find that naughty Unicode dash / quote / ... character that breaks your code
- When editing VS Code settings in JSON, there is a pencil in the gutter which shows you a drop-down menu of valid setting values (if appropriate).

- The [Witch Hazel by Thea Codes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheaFlowers.witch-hazel) and [GitHub](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) themes.

- What all the buttons in the right-hand menu mean - @jryon
- I liked learning about the timeline that has both git commits and save points for the files - @bjcubsfan
- HTRI: the version control tools are neat - @noahbittner
- I am pretty new to VS code. It seems like there is a bit of a steep learning curve to figure out some of the cooler features. Favorite aspect thus far: I like that I can run a terminal, test code and run Jupyter session all in one space. - rhiannong123
