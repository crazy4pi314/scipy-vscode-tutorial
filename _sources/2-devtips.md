# Scientific Python development tips and tricks

**Code navigation** - Learn how to speed up how you navigate through code.

- IntelliSense
- Symbol search (`@`, `@:`)
- [Balancing inward/outward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwqhFb4B5LU)
- Multi-line editing
- Find references
- Regex search
- Code transform
- Text selection
  - Select left/right: Ctrl+shift+arrow
  - Box select: alt

**Running and testing code** - Now that we finally know our way around the editor itâ€™s time to write and test some code! Here weâ€™ll go through a few exercises that let you test the code youâ€™ve written in the previous exercise and debug it.

- Shift + enter
- YAML extension + json/yaml schema = ðŸ’–
- Play button
- Unit tests extension
- Debugger


**Git and version control** - Youâ€™ve written some code - itâ€™s time to push it upstream. Weâ€™ll go over some exercises that let you use the built-in Git tools to interact with the repository we cloned in the previous section.

- Git integration: branching, staging, committing, diff in-line
- Git Lens + integration with Git
- Pre-commit hooks
- GitHub actions (extensions to run them locally)

**Documentation** - Don't forget to document your work! Here we'll go over some tools in VS Code and GitHub to level up your docs.

- Sphinx + readthedocs
- LaTeX math rendering extension
- Docusaurus + github pages

**Data science tools** - After writing your code, letâ€™s put it to use. Here weâ€™ll cover some of VS Codeâ€™s specialized features for data science, and install some typical extensions that plug into the scientific Python ecosystem.

- Figures
- Jupyter notebooks: coding, testing and debugging
- Data wrangler
- Database queries
