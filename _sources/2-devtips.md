# Scientific Python development tips and tricks

**Code navigation** - Learn how to speed up how you navigate through code.

- IntelliSense
- Symbol search
- Multi-line editing
- Find references
- Regex search
- Code transform

**Running and testing code** - Now that we finally know our way around the editor it’s time to write and test some code! Here we’ll go through a few exercises that let you test the code you’ve written in the previous exercise and debug it.

- Shift + enter
- YAML extension
- Code runner extension
- Unit tests extension
- Debugger


**Git and version control** - You’ve written some code - it’s time to push it upstream. We’ll go over some exercises that let you use the built-in Git tools to interact with the repository we cloned in the previous section.

- Git integration: branching, staging, committing, diff in-line
- Git Lens + integration with Git
- Pre-commit hooks
- GitHub actions (extensions to run them locally)

**Documentation** - Don't forget to document your work! Here we'll go over some tools in VS Code and GitHub to level up your docs.

- Sphinx + readthedocs
- LaTeX math rendering extension
- Docusaurus + github pages

**Data science tools** - After writing your code, let’s put it to use. Here we’ll cover some of VS Code’s specialized features for data science, and install some typical extensions that plug into the scientific Python ecosystem.

- Figures
- Jupyter notebooks: coding, testing and debugging
- Data wrangler
- Database queries
