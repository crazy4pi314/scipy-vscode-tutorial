# Interacting with remote resources

**Work where you want to** - Here we will go over some ways on how to work with VS Code on any device and how you can transfer your settings from your local editor. This can be helpful when on-the-go or if you want to make your project easily accessible without any installation requirements. We’ll cover basic tools you will need to develop on a remote resource, such as a cloud instance for compute-heavy workloads.

- Interlude: where does VS Code come from: Monaco, fully-fledged source-code editor for the browser
- GitHub Codespaces - Run Python in the browser
- Remote development extension pack
- SSH remote extension
- Automatic port forwarding
- (Optional) Setting up VS Code with WSL
- DevContainers
- Vscode.dev
- Jupyter servers
- Tunneling


**Home brewing** - Finally, if you prefer not to use cloud resources or have extra compute resources lying around, we’ll show you how you can use VS Code on your own server. We’ll also cover setting up VS Code iPad or Surface tablet, for developing on-the-go. If you’d like to set up the latter with us during the tutorial, make sure to bring your own tablet.

- Run your own VS Code server
- Code on your iPad or Surface
