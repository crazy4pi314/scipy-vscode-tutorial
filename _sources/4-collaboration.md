# Working together, but make it fast

**Coding but faster** - We’ll do some exercises to show you how to speed up your coding practice.

- Keyboard shortcuts
- Bring your keymaps: vim/emacs/sublime/…
- Snippet extension

**Collaboration** - Here we’ll pair you up with someone else and go through some pair programming and code review exercises enabled by some powerful VS Code extensions. This exercise will require you to have a GitHub account.

- Pair programming with Live Share extension
- GitHub PR review extension

**Exercise**: Post a live share, build a new feature together, make commits to your project, open a pull request and review the code.

**Let AI code for you** - Of course, we cannot have a VS Code tutorial without showing this much talked about feature! We’ll go over some exercises to create new code using GitHub CoPilot’s VS Code extension.

- GitHub CoPilot: free for students and open-source contributors
- GitHub CoPilot Labs

**It’s Okay To Have Fun!** - Finally, we’ll show you some fun extensions that can help take the edge off of a busy workday.

- Vscode-pets
- Power Mode
- Music time

**Wrap-up & Epilogue** - It’s time to close out the tutorial and recap everything we’ve learned so far. We also want to end with some final remarks and recommendations.

- Recap of features/lessons
- Concluding remarks and recommendations
  - Where to look for more info and learning (docs, release notes, youtube channel)
  - Links on how to build your own VS Code extension
