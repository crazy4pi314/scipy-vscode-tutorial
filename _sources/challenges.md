# Bonus Challenges

If you are looking for more things to try out or are already a pro on the current section, try out one of the suggestions below.

Show one of the presenters when you are done for a surprise!

## Make an OSS contribution to VS Code or a VS Code Extension

Check out the [good first issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/contribute) on the actual VS Code repo itself, the [Python](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/contribute) or [Jupyter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/contribute) extensions, or on one of your other favorite extension! 

## Try your hand at making a VS Code Extension

Maybe there is a feature or tool you wish your VS Code setup would have, now is the time to try!
[Normally the extensions are in Typescript](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension), but there is [a cool template](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/python-extension-template) that allows you to use Python to build extensions.
There is also [a great docs page](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/overview) covering the API VS Code exposes for the Python language server.
It doesn't have to be super fancy, but see if you can get a demo extension file to share with someone else to try.

## Containerize your favorite project

Having infrastructure and tools to make OSS projects more reproducible is quite helpful, so let's try and put some more code back in boxes :P
Take a repo that is missing things like Dockerfiles, Devcontainers, or packaging actions and PR them!
