# Scientific Python development tips and tricks

**Code navigation** - Learn how to speed up how you navigate through code.

- IntelliSense
- Symbol search (`@`, `@:`)
- [Balancing inward/outward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwqhFb4B5LU)
- Multi-line editing
- Find references
- Regex search
- Code transform
- Text selection
  - Select left/right: Ctrl+shift+arrow
  - Box select: alt

> **Exercise**: Explore code navigation
>
> 1. Create a new file `hello.py` in the `tutorial` package with a function `say_hello` that prints a message using the `emoji` library. Use IntelliSense to find the right function and order of input arguments from the library.
> 2. Output the text of Zen of Python into a file by running `python -c "import this" > zen_of_python.md`.
> 3. Open the file and replace the word "is" with the word "was". How many keystrokes does it take to make this replacement in the editor?
> 4. Use regex search to find all sentences that have the pattern `\w+ better than \w+.`. Replace it with `is awesome!`.
> 5. Use Alt+ â†‘ / â†“ to move the line "Readability counts." to the top.

**Running and testing code** - Now that we finally know our way around the editor itâ€™s time to write and test some code! Here weâ€™ll go through a few exercises that let you test the code youâ€™ve written in the previous exercise and debug it.

- Shift + enter
- YAML extension + json/yaml schema = ðŸ’–
- Play button
- Unit tests extension
- Debugger

> **Exercise**: Debug code with tests
>
> 1. Create a new folder called `tests` and a new file `test_hello.py`.
> 2. Import the functions you've created in the first exercise using `from tutorial.hello import say_hello` and create a new function `test_say_hello` that calls `say_hello`.
> 3. Open the "Testing" menu by clicking on the vial icon in the Activity bar, click "Configure Python Tests" and choose "pytest". Pick the `tests` folder.
> 4. Run your test by clicking on the "Run Test" â–· icon.
> 5. Add a new `name` input argument to the `say_hello` function. Run your test again. Can you fix the bug?

**Git and version control** - Youâ€™ve written some code - itâ€™s time to push it upstream. Weâ€™ll go over some exercises that let you use the built-in Git tools to interact with the repository we cloned in the previous section.

- Git integration: branching, staging, committing, diff in-line
- Git Lens + integration with Git
- Pre-commit hooks
- GitHub actions (extensions to run them locally)

> **Exercise** Sign our yearbook!
>
> 1. Fork the [tutorial repo](https://aka.ms/scipy2023) to your GitHub account
> 2. Edit the file `yearbook2023.md` and add your favorite VS Code tip you've learned so far. Sign it with your GitHub handle.
> 3. Create a new branch using the menu `Branch` > `Create branch`, and name it `<your username>/yearbook-2023`.
> 4. Commit your changes to your new branch and push the changes using `Commit & Push`.
> 5. Create a PR to the origin repo, either with the GitHub PR extension or via the GitHub web interface so we can review and merge!

**Documentation** - Don't forget to document your work! Here we'll go over some tools in VS Code and GitHub to level up your docs.

- `autoDocstring` extension
- Sphinx
- LaTeX math rendering extension

> **Exercise** Document your code
>
> 1. Configure the `autoDocstring` extension to use `sphinx` as its Docstring format.
> 2. Add a docstring to the `say_hello` function you created in an earlier exercise.
> 3. (Optional) Run `sphinx-quickstart` to set up your Sphinx documentation and follow the steps in this [tutorial](https://github.com/melissawm/minimalsphinx) by @melissawm.
> 4. (Optional) Install the LaTeX Workshop extension (requires [TeX live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)). Create a new folder `docs` with file `about.tex`. Start writing a page in [LaTeX](https://www.colorado.edu/aps/sites/default/files/attached-files/latex_primer.pdf) and explore the IntelliSense features.

**Data science tools** - After writing your code, letâ€™s put it to use. Here weâ€™ll cover some of VS Codeâ€™s specialized features for data science, and install some typical extensions that plug into the scientific Python ecosystem.

- Figures
- Jupyter notebooks: coding, testing and debugging
- Data wrangler
- Database queries
- [Data science profile](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles#_data-science-profile-template)

> **Exercise** Data Science in VS Code
>
> 1. Create a new Data Science profile.
> 2. Open the `demo.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
> 3. Run the example cells in the notebook. Try adding a markdown cell and add some text, or add a code cell.
> 4. Open the example data file `bees.csv` using Data Wrangler and explore the dataset (source: [Bee-Gap: Ecology, Life-History, and Distribution of Bee Species in the United States 2017](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5bd868b2e4b0b3fc5ce9dadd)).
> Can you figure out which common plant name is most loved by all bee species recorded?
