# Meet your coding best friend: VS Code ðŸ’– - A hands-on tutorial on how to get the most out of the worldâ€™s most popular Python editor

This repository accompanies the [VS Code tutorial at SciPy 2023](https://cfp.scipy.org/2023/talk/RKV3PZ/) of the same title.

Basic knowledge of Python and git will allow you to take best advantage of this tutorial. No previous experience with VS Code is required.

## Installation instructions

### Start instantly with GitHub Codespaces

1. [Create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one already

1. On the landing page of [this repository](https://github.com/crazy4pi314/scipy-vscode-tutorial), click on the green _Code_ button, and then on the _Codespaces_ tab to create a codespace.

After a short while you should have a VS Code window in your browser with the repository open.

Note: by default, the container running your code space will have 2 CPU cores, 4 GB of RAM, and 32 GB of local storage.

### Work on your computer

1. [Install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
1. [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/crazy4pi314/scipy-vscode-tutorial`
1. Open the repository in VS Code: `code scipy-vscode-tutorial`

You should now have the repository open in your local VS Code instance.

With VS Code ready to go, it's time to jump into the [tutorial outline](outline.md).

## Structure of this repository

This repository contains a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) setup that provides [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) and [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) for setting up Python environments.
This repo contains a sample Conda environment file ([environment.yml](environment.yml)), demo Jupyter notebook, and Dev Container configuration files that describe how a containerized development can be built for the repo.
These configuration files work for both local Dev Containers as well as [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), a GitHub-hosted cloud environment.

The Docker setup for the Dev Container starts with a miniconda image that then will install whatever conda environment file you have at the root of the repo.
There are some additional configuration options in the comments of the [Docker](.devcontainer/Dockerfile) and [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) that have some examples of other steps you may want to add to your Dev Container, like what VS Code extensions to install when the container is launched.
